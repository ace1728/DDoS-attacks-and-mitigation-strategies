# DDoS-attacks-and-mitigation-strategies
 A Denial-of-Service attack is a cyber-attack in which a malicious actor attempts to make a 
computer’s resource unavailable to its intended users. <br>These attacks can be carried out in various 
circumstances, the medium of carrying it out and who is the victim of this attack which decides whether 
the attack is malicious or not. Those who perform these attacks usually target sites or services hosted 
on high profile web servers like payment gateways and such.<br> This term can be seen in regards to 
computer networks but its scope does not end here. It holds a much wider domain especially when we 
talk about CPU resource management. DoS attacks are performed as two general types:<br> first that floods 
the services of the victim machine and second, that crashes its services. A common method to use this 
attack saturates the victim machine with external requests of communication rendering it unable to 
respond to legitimate traffic. In layman’s terms attacks are executed to cause the victim machine to 
either reset or consuming its resources such that its intended services can no longer be used or 
hindering the communication pathway between the intended users and the victim so that they can no 
longer communicate satisfactorily. Developing an incident response plan is the critical first step toward 
comprehensive defence strategy. Depending on the infrastructure, a DoS response plan can get quite 
exhaustive. The first step you take when a malicious attack happens can define how it will end. Make 
sure your data centre is prepared, and each module is properly fulfilling their responsibilities. That 
way, you can minimize the impact on your system and save yourself months of recovery. Multi-level 
protection strategies in place such as advanced intrusion prevention and threat management systems, 
which combine firewalls, VPN, anti-spam, content filtering, load balancing, and other layers of DDoS 
defence techniques. Together they enable constant and consistent network protection to prevent a 
DDoS attack from happening. This includes everything from identifying possible traffic 
inconsistencies with the highest level of precision in blocking the attack.
